This website hosts transcripts of episodes of AXRP, pronounced axe-urp, short for the AI X-risk Research Podcast. On this podcast, I ([Daniel Filan](https://danielfilan.com/)) have conversations with researchers about their papers. We discuss the paper and hopefully get a sense of why it's been written and how it might reduce the risk of artificial intelligence causing an [existential catastrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk): that is, permanently and drastically curtailing humanity's future potential. 

This podcast launched in December 2020. [Finan Adamson](https://www.finanadamsonvoice.com/) edited the podcast between February 2021 and February 2022, and remains the audio consultant. Jack Garrett worked on editing between March 2022 and October 2024, and wrote the opening and closing music. As of August 2022, Amber Dawn Ace helps with transcription, and as of October 2024, editing is done by Kate Brunotts.

You might also enjoy the game ["Guess That AXRP"](https://guess-that-axrp.onrender.com), which involves guessing which episode a randomly selected sentence has come from.
