This website hosts transcripts of episodes of AXRP, pronounced axe-urp, short for the AI X-risk Research Podcast. On this podcast, I ([Daniel Filan](https://danielfilan.com/)) have conversations with researchers about their research. We discuss their work and hopefully get a sense of why it's been written and how it might reduce the risk of artificial intelligence causing an [existential catastrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk): that is, permanently and drastically curtailing humanity's future potential.
