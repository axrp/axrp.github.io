Some announcements:
- There's a brief [survey](https://bit.ly/axrpsurvey2023) of my audience you can take here - filling it out will help me get a sense of where you all are at career-wise and how the podcast would better serve you. There are only 3 required questions, and they're multiple choice! It would be great if you could fill it out [here](https://bit.ly/axrpsurvey2023).
- The AXRP [store](https://store.axrp.net) is closing in a week - so if you want to buy merchandise, now's your last chance to do so! To buy merch like laptop stickers, t-shirts, sweaters, or jigsaw puzzles (in the US), go to the store [at this link](https://store.axrp.net).
- If you want to financially support the podcast, you can do so in two ways:
    - On [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/axrpodcast) - donations of US$20 per month get to see my episode notes, and at US$50 per month, you have a (currently very high) chance of being thanked by name at the end of episodes! Link is [here](https://www.patreon.com/axrpodcast).
    - On [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/axrpodcast), where you can give one-off donations.
- Interviews will always be free and available to non-subscribers, but your support gives me a better sense of how many people get value out of this podcast, and how much time I should spend on it.
