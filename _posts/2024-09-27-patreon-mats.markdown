Some announcements:
- Reward tiers for the [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/axrpodcast) have become more generous! The current tiers:
    - For US$5/mo, you can see pictures of the notes I make in preparation for interviews, as well as notes I make during interviews.
    - For US$20/mo, you can see the episode notes as well as being thanked for your support in text on-screen at the end of [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@axrpodcast) of interviews, under the heading "AXRPatrons".
    - For US$50/mo, you can see the epsiode notes, be thanked in text on-screen at the end of videos under the heading "Super-patrons", and be thanked verbally in the outro of interviews.
- Applications are now open for the [MATS](https://www.matsprogram.org/) Winter 2024-2025 cohort, but they close October 6th. 
    - Mentors who have been on AXRP who you could work with include [Alex Turner](https://axrp.net/episode/2021/09/25/episode-11-attainable-utility-power-alex-turner.html), [Buck Shlegeris](https://axrp.net/episode/2024/04/11/episode-27-ai-control-buck-shlegeris-ryan-greenblatt.html), [Evan Hubinger](https://axrp.net/episode/2021/02/17/episode-4-risks-from-learned-optimization-evan-hubinger.html), [Scott Emmons](https://axrp.net/episode/2024/06/12/episode-33-rlhf-problems-scott-emmons.html), and [Stephen Casper](https://axrp.net/episode/2023/05/02/episode-21-interpretability-for-engineers-stephen-casper.html).
    - There are also mentors who focus on [AI governance](https://www.matsprogram.org/governance).

    - Note: I work for MATS, so am not totally neutral, but they're not paying me to advertise them, I genuinely think it's a great program.
